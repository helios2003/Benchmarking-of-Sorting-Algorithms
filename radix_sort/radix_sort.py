"""
ALGORITHM:
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts an array by grouping the elements by their individual digits. 
It can sort integers, strings, and other data types that can be represented as a sequence of digits. 
Radix Sort works by sorting the digits starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
